## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Firebase Not Initialized
**Error**: "Firebase is not defined"
- **Solution**: Ensure firebase-config.js loads after Firebase CDN scripts in HTML

### Auth Not Working
**Error**: "auth is not initialized"
- **Solution**: 
  - Verify firebase-config.js has correct Firebase credentials
  - Check browser console (F12) for specific errors
  - Make sure Firebase SDK CDN links are loaded first

### Permission Denied in Firestore
**Error**: "Permission denied" when saving activities
- **Solution**:
  - Check your Firestore security rules
  - Ensure user is logged in
  - Verify you're using correct user ID in rules

### Google Sign-In Not Working
**Error**: Popup blocked or "popup-closed-by-user"
- **Solution**:
  - Enable popups in browser settings
  - Make sure domain is in Firebase Authorized domains
  - Check that Google is enabled in Authentication settings

### Data Not Persisting
**Error**: Activities disappear after refresh
- **Solution**:
  - Check browser console for Firestore errors
  - Verify Firestore database was created successfully
  - Ensure internet connection is stable

### Charts Not Displaying
**Error**: Empty chart or white canvas area
- **Solution**:
